# Crystadusa's chip8 emulator in rust
### About
I wrote this demo to learn about the rust programming language and emulation. I chose [chip8](https://chip-8.github.io/links/) because it was simple to implement.

### Build
This project is simply built with "cargo build --release".
Remember to set a corresponding cmake generator on windows with a developer shell like MinGW32 or WSL.
